## Technologies Used

* **HTML** – Structure of the calculator
* **CSS** – Styling, layout, and animations
* **JavaScript** – Logic, DOM manipulation, and event handling

## How It Works

The calculator builds mathematical expressions based on user input from buttons or keyboard events. These expressions are evaluated and displayed instantly. Event listeners are used to manage button clicks, keyboard input, and UI updates.
